PSET 1
==========


In this problem set we're going to write a couple of basic CS50 C programs in Java.

First and foremost:

* Watch the [LaunchCodeTV Java series](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java-on-the-command-line?lesson=Java) to help get your environment setup.
* Purcase the book ["Clean Code" by Robert Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* Create the "Mario" application (described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32BxNe2Sfc)) using Java instead of C
* Watch this [video on Java Strings](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings?lesson=Java) and this [video on Java String Performance](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings_performance?lesson=Java)
* When it is complete commit the project as a new repository to Github.
* When you're done, send me an email by using the email address on my [Profile Page](https://github.com/MoMenne)

Creating Mario using Java will help you get used to the Java syntax as well as familiarize yourself with loops and Strings.
