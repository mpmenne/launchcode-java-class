Singleton Design Pattern and the Spring Framework.

The Singleton design pattern is one of the most widely used and abused Design Patterns in Java.
The Spring Framework prevents Singleton abuse and makes you look like a Rockstar.

Steps:
  * Refactor Mario to use the Singleton Design Pattern as described in the [following video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_singleton?lesson=Java).
  * Be sure to note that the Singleton pattern, while good does have it's disadvantages.  Watch [this video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_dependency_injection?lesson=Java)
  * Refactor your code so that you replace the Singleton pattern with Dependency Injection.  Watch [this video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_spring_framework?lesson=Java) about using the Spring Framework to manage your Dependency Injection
  * In order to use Spring, you have to add a few new Java library jars to your project.  Watch [this video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_maven?lesson=Java) on Maven to learn how to do so.
  
Last problem working with Mario; moving on to some of my favorite topics of the entire course.

Email me when you're done.
