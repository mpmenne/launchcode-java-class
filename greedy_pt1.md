Implement the "Greedy" homework on assignment of CS50 in Java.

Your application must calculate the fewest number of coins required to represent a given amount as described in [Zamyla's video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/cs50_greedy?lesson=CS50)

Also, remember that the United States now has $1 coins in circulation.

* Create a command line application in Java that prompts the user for the amount of change to be returned (For Example, $3.20)
* Just like in Greedy for C, calculate the fewest number of coins required to fulfill that amount of change
* Use the following [video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_maven_project_structure?lesson=Java) and the following [project template](https://github.com/MoMenne/launchcode-greedy-template) to create a project that is Maven capable, Spring enabled, and Unit Testable.
* Watch the following videos on [Unit Testing](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_unit_testing?lesson=Java) and [Test Driven Development](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_test_driven_development?lesson=Java)
* Use unit testing to ensure that your application calculates the correct number of coins everytime.  

Bonus!  Your program was a big hit.  Now make a version for European cashiers based on EU coin system.  See [EU Coins Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_coins)
* Your decision on what currency to use should be based on the currency denomination given as input (i.e. â‚¬1 would use EU conversion)
* Keep things testable and use your knowledge of design patterns to make the transition seemless
* Be sure to use TDD when writing the tests for your new Euro functionality
