In this problem set we're going to expand upon our Mario application by refactoring to use the Factory Design Pattern.

* First, cleanup Mario.java.  Refactor your code so that a Pyramid class encapsulates the core logic.
* Next, ensure that your Printer interface only accepts Pyramids.  Use "toString" on the pyramid as described in [this video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_override?lesson=Java)).
* Finally, implement the Factory Design Pattern to hide the instantiation of the Pyramid objects [ here's how video](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_factory_design_pattern?lesson=Java).    

Head First Design Patterns that does a great job of explaing how this pattern works and is implemented.
