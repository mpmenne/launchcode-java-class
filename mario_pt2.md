PSET 2 
==========


In this problem set you're going to expand the functionality that you wrote in your Mario java program.

Your goal is to offer the user the option of printing Mario to the console OR to a text file.

What to do:

* Refactor your existing Mario to use proper Java packages.  Open your project in an IDE (preferably Intellij IDEA)
* Check out the following video on how to create a [Java project in under 4 minutes](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_game_10min?lesson=Java) 
* Also watch the following videos on [Strings](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings?lesson=Java) and [String Performance](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strings_performance?lesson=Java).  Feel free to refactor your code accordingly.
* Implement the functionality mentioned in the summary.  When complete, commit and push to your repository.
* You should notice that your code has lots of if statements... we're going to get rid of those by using the Strategy Design Pattern
* Watch the video [Strategy Design Pattern in Java](http://tv.launchcode.us/#/videos/java_strategy?lesson=Java)
* Use the Strategy Design Pattern to make your code clean and awesome. 
* When you're done, send me an email by using the email address on my [Profile Page](https://github.com/MoMenne)
